# DOARB

Provide a brief (1 paragraph or less), meaningful description of the project and what it does. If the project has a UI, include a screenshot as well.

If more comprehensive documentation exists, link to it here.

## Features

Describe the core features of the project (what does it do?) in the form of a bulleted list:

- Feature #1
- Feature #2
- Feature #3

## OFPEC Tags

An OFPEC tag is a three to five letter identifier that is unique to each designer and is used as a prefix to variables in addons and scripts to avoid global namespace conflicts with other addons and scripts.
All tags will be followed by an underscore (whether you include one or not) and that's how they should be used when naming variables and files: TAG_namespace.

### Installation/Dependencies

How does a user get up and running with your project? What dependencies does the project have? Aim to describe these in clear and simple steps. Provide external links

### Usage

### Build/Deployment

If the user will be building or deploying the project, add any useful guidance.

## Getting Help

What should users do and expect when they encounter bugs or get stuck using your project? Set expectations for support, link to the issue tracker and roadmap, if applicable.

Where should users go if they have a question? (Stack Overflow, Gitter, IRC, mailing list, etc.)

If desired, you may also provide links to core contributor email addresses.

## Contributing Guidelines

Include instructions for setting up the development environment, code standards, running tests, and submitting pull requests. Aim to be inclusive and welcoming. It may be useful to link to a seperate CONTRIBUTING.md file. See this example from the Hoodie project as an exemplar: https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
