## OFPEC Tags

An OFPEC tag is a three to five letter identifier that is unique to each designer and is used as a prefix to variables in addons and scripts to avoid global namespace conflicts with other addons and scripts.
All tags will be followed by an underscore (whether you include one or not) and that's how they should be used when naming variables and files: TAG_namespace.
