# DOARB

Provide a brief (1 paragraph or less), meaningful description of the project and what it does. If the project has a UI, include a screenshot as well.

## OFPEC Tags

An OFPEC tag is a three to five letter identifier that is unique to each designer and is used as a prefix to variables in addons and scripts to avoid global namespace conflicts with other addons and scripts.
All tags will be followed by an underscore (whether you include one or not) and that's how they should be used when naming variables and files: TAG_namespace.

## Contributing Guidelines

Include instructions for setting up the development environment, code standards, running tests, and submitting pull requests. Aim to be inclusive and welcoming. It may be useful to link to a seperate CONTRIBUTING.md file. See this example from the Hoodie project as an exemplar: https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
